# Thoughts and review on Timelapse from HTB
This machine is easy if you have a base fundamental knowledge of Windows machines, domain enviorments and powershell. If not, this box will provide some good learning experiences. Enumeration is very important, not just here but overall, and for this box you will need to do some proper enumeation. I can't post a walkthrough yet I believe, due to HackTheBox policies, this is quite a recent box, released 22 days ago. When it's ok, I will post my writeup for this machine. In the mean time here are the sources I used and referenced.
